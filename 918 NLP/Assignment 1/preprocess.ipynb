       " 'country music sort of lives in this bubble and everyone is little bit scared to poke that by sarah boesveld september    pm the country radio dj pauses before biting the bullet has anyone been like what the hell are you doing she asks every single day thomas rhett says without missing beat half hour earlier dozen industry types seated before massive control board and big cake sheet lined with strawberries bopped their heads to rhetts progressive country record one marketed to lead sonic shift in genre of which they are still the gatekeepers oooh you look so dang hot in my tshirt thumps one track titled tshirt appropriately enough that likens the girl in the song to model in guns roses video pour little liquor in my coconut water repeats the infectious hook of vacation theres rap interlude from lunch money lewis sexy duet with pop star jordin sparks the artist blaring from the speakers sat just outside the listening session too nervous he said to watch people take in tracks from his sophomore album tangled up he strides in when its over bedroom eyes scanning the room for reaction its fun the group initially declares before the question on everyones mind gets asked the son of 90s country singer and nashville songwriter rhett akins rhett made his debut in  with bro songs like get me some of that and it goes like this his star seemingly reliant on the dirt road theme of the day but in the past year rhetts undergone metamorphosis first with his beegeesinspired make me wanna and then with crash burn the sam cookestyle debut single off forthcoming record that marries soul pop disco electronic dance music edm and dash of rap with whats typically known as country the single rhett was terrified to release has since become his fastest rising biggest selling song and nestled in the country billboard top  this summer betwixt hits like sam hunts partyhearty house party and like wrecking ball the soulful sexjam from erich church his risk at least feels of the moment there is comfort in acknowledging the chartbusting success of genreblurring acts like florida georgia line who rhett has supported on tour luke bryan and hunt whose nearly purepop and rb debut album has made him something of controversial pioneer its very liberating rhett said in an interview reflecting on his move away from bro and towards something entirely new someone the other day was like man dont know if you know this but feel like youre on the brink of leading new direction of music but in the minds of traditionalists new direction isnt something to which country musician should aspire to guys like kyle coroneos who runs the website savingcountrymusiccom country is genre not to be tampered with country music is about preserving tradition it always has been and always will be he calls this discoedm iteration brohangover the idea that bringing other genreinfluences into country right now is risky or pushing the envelope or taking the genre somewhere new and exciting is disingenuous he says instead it contributes to one giant monogenre which he believes the merging of hiphop and country has become the risk for country music is when you start going this far out of your boundaries you begin to lose control of the music you begin to lose control of your identity he said country music is unique because it has so much of its own infrastructure and traditions no other genre of music has four major awards shows every year not even rock or edm or rap the genreblending and trendchasing is exactly the fate that befell rock radio he said in the 1990s and early 2000s rock became the catchall phrase he said what happened was it lost its identity and it sort of imploded think it could happen with country music rhett doesnt believe his music is going to cause the downfall of country music were one of those genres that sort of lives in this bubble that everyone is little bit scared to poke that bubble because were worried about what will happen when that bubble breaks said rhett to me want to be that artist that when my buddies are watching me sidestage theyll say dang cant believe they just did that in their concert or they hear song on the record and go how in the world did they cut that song and get away with it theres something kind of rebelliously fun about it he cites mainstream country rebel church as inspiration his latest rockinfluenced record the outsiders is stacked with successful radio hits despite its many middlefingertotheman moments but in the minds of critics that rebelliousness is far cry from the stuff of willie waylon and more indicative of nashville chasing the next biggest moneymaking thing despite all of the pop experimentation the country music genre lives in two stubborn solitudes theres real country and theres that crap you hear on the radio but if youre going to refer to something as real country you have to have definition of what real country is if thomas rhett wants to put out an album in the style of bruno mars and have edm and rb stuff am  for it you go thomas rhett you do that but dont do it and sell it to country fans country musics identity is very much rooted in geography theres texas swing out of the lone star state theres kentucky bluegrass theres the bakersfield sound in california which was grittier more direct response to the slick sounds coming out of countrypolitan nashville perhaps the current outcry of traditionalists is little reminiscent of the origins of rock roll the combination of blues country and gospel broke all the rules in the 1950s and pushed so many gatekeeper buttons while rhetts hip gyrations are the closest hell ever get to elvis maybe his bruno mars covers are indeed pushing the boundaries in good way reminding the country music world that nothing ever new or interesting has come from colouring inside the lines and if there would be no rock roll without blues country and gospel there would be no co',\n",

just dont have another house thats like this that didnt make the property white elephant though when grey asked several real estate agents in the bay area whether there was market for the unusual home

just took  million price cut despite their differences houses like these raise common question how does anyone real estate professionals sellers or buyers figure out what offthewall overthetop homes are worth the volcano house was owned by tv personality huell howser who gave it to chapman university in  year before his death the university had originally planned to use the house for desert studies astronomy and geology pursuits but its selling the property because its desert location in newberry springs east of barstow was deemed too isolated for students brady sandahl of hom sothebys international realty says he and another agent listing the house considered other architecturally significant properties mostly in the high desert in coming up with the  price tag you just develop business gut as to what you think the market will capture he said then you turn to the buyers and theyll tell you why theyre giving you what theyre giving you thats the beauty of an open market sandahl said the multiple offers he received show the asking price was appropriate three offers came in at  or more but clearly the price tag would be higher if the property wasnt so remote this is real estate said grey who appraised the flintstone house the first three rules of real estate are location location location the flintstone house is on the opposite side of that rule its  miles from san francisco and right near i280 major freeway when youre in the yard of the flintstone house grey said you hear that freeway very clearly while the noise outside the home is minus on the plus side grey said the house itself is nearly soundproof its like being in cave he attributes that to the construction steel rebar and wire mesh frames were built over large inflated weather balloons then covered with gunite or shotcrete he said that makes the walls thicker than typical homes appraising even unusual homes involves the basics grey said size number of rooms quality of finishes and condition are all factors considered in addition to location those are relevant to any house no matter how unusual or historical or plain it is he said the comps with no truly comparable homes grey said he used bracketing system to determine where the flintstone house fit on spectrum he placed the areas highend tudor homes and plain ranch homes at opposite ends appraising something its quite bit more art than science he said in terms of appraising that house put it right in the middle he did not make comparisons with unusual homes elsewhere in the country he said with land value varying
